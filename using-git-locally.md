# Using Git Locally

We can clone our repo and use it locally on our machine, then sync (push) the changes to the web. *These instructions are for those using Windows.*

- Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Install it
	- Set editor to `Nano` (this is the default option)

- Fork the repo (on GitHub.com)
	- Go to `https://github.com/nickbearman/Contributing-to-QGIS-Documentation`
	- Click the ![](img/fork.png){ height=35 } button to copy the repo to your profile and wait a few seconds while it completes
	- Click **Clone or download**
	- Use the copy clipboard icon ![](img/copy-to-clipboard.png){ height=35 } to copy the path to the clipboard

- Clone repo (on your computer)
	- Go to wherever your folder is
	- Right click and choose **Git Bash Here**
	- Type in `git clone ` and paste in the URL (using Shift-Insert)
	- Press enter. *This will copy the repository from your GitHub web account to your local machine*

- Make a change to the file on your machine

- Add and commit
	- Use `git status` to find out where you are and what to do next
	- In Git Bash, type `git add <file>`
	- Type `git commit` and add your Git commit comment

- Push to your remote repo
	- `git push`
	- *It should give you a link on GitHub saying `Create a pull request`, if so, go to this link, and skip the next step*. 
	
- Create Pull Request (on GitHub)
	- Select ![](img/compare-across-forks.png){ height=30 }. 
	- Compare `nickbearman/Contributing-to-QGIS-Documentation` with `<your username>/Contributing-to-QGIS-Documentation`.
	- Click **Create Pull Request**. 
	
- Add details and submit your pull request (on GitHub)
	- Fill in the details and click **Create pull request**. 
	

Then try adding an image in RST. See `example-1.rst` for an example. 

Working on GitHub website only.
Make updates, Create pull request. 
Push changes

on web, create pull request. 
merge pull request,
this brings everything up to date.
